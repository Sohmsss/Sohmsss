# Hey, I’m Freddie 👋

I work in **growth and innovation** at [Holiday Extras](https://www.holidayextras.com), exploring how **AI, data, and experimentation** can make travel better and ideas move faster.

I love building things, from **AI tools** and **automations** to **side projects** that make work (and life) smoother.

🧠 Interested in: AI, growth strategy, automation  
⚙️ Usually building with: Node.js & Python  
🥋 Outside of work: Muay Thai obsessive
